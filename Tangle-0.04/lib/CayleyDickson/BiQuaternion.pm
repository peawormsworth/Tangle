# DualQuaternion.pm - represent and operate on dual complex numbers

#
# Generally, these are quaternions with bi complex coefficients
#
# I don't see any difference from these and BiComplex numbers that are constructed into quaternions
# using standard Cayley Dickson construction techniques....
#
# So there is no real code here except a package name. It's just a BiComplex for now.
