package BiOctonion;
use base qw(BiQuaternion);

#
# DualQuaternion.pm - represent and operate on dual complex numbers
#
# ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioctonion
#
# Generally, these are octonions with bicomplex coefficients
#
# I don't see any difference from these and BiQuaternion numbers that are constructed into Octonions
# using standard Cayley Dickson construction techniques....
#
# So there is no real code here except a package name. It's just a BiQuaternion for now.
