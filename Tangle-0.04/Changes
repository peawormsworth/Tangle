	- original version; created based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley-Dickson_construction

        - cleaned up code and spacing. Improved variable naming.
        - improved and expanded tests including CayleyDickson module tests
        - added pod documentation to Tangle.
        - improvements on the CNOT gate. Uses a quaternion for initial rotation.
        - added dimension testing: is_complex, is_quaternion, etc to CayleyDickson.pm
        - removed the triple references from the Cayley Dickson module, where they are not used.
        - Triple references moved into Tangle.pm, where they are used.
        - Changed gamma variable to I_SQUARED to more easily reveal its meaning as i^2 which is usually -1.
        - the outputs from the cnot are tied back to the inputs shared memory in a different manner.

        - added the 8 doubling products available. ref: http://jwbales.us/cdproducts.html
        - compactified the gates for easy diffrentiation by eye.
        - completed CayleyDickson pod documentation.
        - use the is_complex() function instead of calling on ref of a allows for numbers to be other objects.

0.04 TBD
        - added object for Dual, Split and Bi-complex number ojbects. And Complex, Quaternion and Oction modules for each.
        - I believe CNOT gate is an operation like: cnot(z) = Q1 × z × 1/Q1, but I dont' know Q1.
